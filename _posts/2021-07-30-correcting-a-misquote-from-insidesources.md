title: Correcting a misquote from InsideSources

categories: [Monetary Policy]

excerpt: The Fed's inflation target is two percent, not "two percent or less."

---

I recently had a nice conversation with Gregory Bresiger for [his InsideSources article](https://insidesources.com/biden-vows-to-spend-big-control-inflation-can-he-do-both/) on inflation. Unfortunately, I'm misquoted. (Emphasis mine.)

>Offering a somewhat more sanguine assessment, Christopher Russo, a research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, argued that regardless of the Biden administration’s policy ambitions, **the Federal Reserve will seek to keep annual inflation at two percent or less a year**, tempering what critics warn may be the fallout from excessive White House policies.

>“The Fed understands the lesson of the 1970s and I believe they will make the right call as long as they retain their political independence,” he said.

Rather, I argued that the Fed will seek for annual inflation to average 2 percent over time. The target is symmetric so there's no "or less." Since we've undershot 2 percent, the Fed now seeks to have inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time. 

I did my best to explain this point on the call. I have every confidence it's an honest mistake, and I don't expect the piece to get into the weeds of average inflation targeting. Nevertheless,  as written, the piece implies that I doubt the credibility of the Fed's inflation target.

I've asked Gregory to remove "or less" from the piece.
